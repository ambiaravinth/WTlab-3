    For a truly extraordinary interior design experience the role played by a good lighting system cannot be underestimated. 
		Lighting decoration can not only brighten the space, but its clever use can also elevate the ambient mood of the room. 
		In terms of functionality, home lighting designs performs three important functions viz. general lighting, task lighting 
		and accent lighting. If you want to improve the ambience and visibility of a space, general lighting fixtures such as 
		chandeliers are best suited. For brightening up spaces such as kitchens and study rooms, task lighting design in the form 
		of pendants would be ideal. A dramatic touch and visual appeal can be achieved by using task lighting for home decoration 
		to highlight artwork or photographs in the space.</p></div>
